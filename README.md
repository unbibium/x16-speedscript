SpeedScript X16 Fork
--------------------

SpeedScript is a very small but full-featured word processor, originally written 
by Charles Brannon, and published in Compute Magazine for various 8-bit
computers. This project is a port of the Commodore 64 version of SpeedScript
to the Commander X16.

Progress
--------

The program will work in either 40 or 80 column mode.

You can edit the document.  Words work.

Missing features
----------------

* I/O functions like Save/Load/Print don't seem to work
* Keyboard functions requiring Shift-Ctrl combinations cannot be reached.
* Memory access beyond the first 32K
* Faster screen drawing in 80 column mode
